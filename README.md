  * Lo/Fisher presents the how and why of reporting accounting information from within an easily-understood theoretical framework. Lo/Fisher has a clean layout that engages the reader with a clear writing style using plain English. This text is built on the current International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and incorporates Accounting Standards for Private Enterprise (ASPE) where appropriate. Our philosophy is that when students understand the current standards, they will be able to analyze and interpret changes in the future.
